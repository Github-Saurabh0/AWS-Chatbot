# Multi-Tenant E-Commerce SaaS Platform

## Overview
A Shopify-like SaaS platform built with Java (Spring Boot) that enables multiple businesses (tenants) to host their online stores on a single system. This enterprise-grade solution follows modern best practices and is designed for scalability, security, and extensibility.

## Key Features

### For Tenants (Businesses)
- **Isolated Product Catalog**: Each tenant manages their own products
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Owner, Admin, Analyst, Viewer roles
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Keycloak integration
- **Catalog Management**: Search, categories, pagination
- **Order Processing**: Complete order lifecycle management
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing

### Technical Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: 
  - Auth Service
  - Catalog Service
  - Cart Service
  - Order Service
  - Payment Service
  - API Gateway
- **Multi-Tenant Data Separation**: Postgres row-level tenancy
- **Scalability**: Kafka for event-driven communication, Redis for caching
- **Security**: JWT + role-based APIs + Keycloak integration
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes + CI/CD pipeline

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Cloud
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka
- **Authentication**: JWT, Keycloak
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
